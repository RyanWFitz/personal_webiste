            <div>A little about me: I enjoy many things in life, but possibly what I enjoy the most is the journey that I am taken on while pursuing my hobbies.<hr></div>
            <div class="snowskiiing"><h3>Snow Skiing</h3></div>
                <p>For as long as I can remember, I have always snow skied. My family has been involved in the sport for over 50 years, and as such my father helped coach me from the moment I could walk. This sport allows me to express myself and show how much my dedication is able to pay off, and it opens up opportunities.</p>
                <img class="snowski" src="images_html/snowski_image.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Whenever I bring up sports, snow skiing is my favorite activity there is and it has helped me develop as both a person and a professional. As a young kid, I always wanted to compete at the top level of competition, but a knee injury when I was an early teenager made it so I was unable to continue that path.  </p>
                <p>While I may no longer be trying to compete, I still look to continue my passion chasing the hardest trails and the hardest lines I can find. Typically, this leads me to many new places, whether its skiing the open slopes of Mammoth Mountain or finding the largest powder bank in Alta, Utah, I will always look for new experiences. I've had the pleasure of skiing a large majority of the ski areas in the United States and have a long term goal of trying to visit all of the resorts within North America, it's more of a lofty goal but I think it would be fun to achieve.</p>
                <p>The other benefit snow skiing has brought me is the people that I have met along the way. I have had the opportunity to meet numerous new friends that I have conected with over our love of the sport. I was even lucky enough to participate in one of my closest friend's wedding in Powder Mountain, Utah, where we had the reception at the top of the mountain!</p>

            <div class="waterskiing"><h3>Water Skiing</h3></div>
                <p>Water skiing is a sport that has been around for many years, but is usually something that families do sparingly on that one trip they took to the lake 15 years ago. For a number of families, includiong my own, it is something that we travel the country to do, competing in tournaments in order to qualify for higher tier competitions.</p>
                <img class="waterski" src="images_html/waterski_image.JPG" alt="">
                <p>With water skiing being as small as it is, it surprisingly has a very passionate backing in collegiate sports. I graduated with a BA from Arizona State University, where I spent time as the captain of the team at the school. This position had me take responsibility of both the men's and women's team roster, where I was held accountable for about 40 other student athletes. With 8-10 tournaments a year, including both a regional and national tournament, we remained very busy throughout the school year.</p>
                <p>The relationships that I have been able to build over the years of competing have been impactful in many ways. A large reason why I moved back to California from Arizona was to be able to be around the people I grew up competing with, who are now some of my closest friends. To this day I still compete in tournaments at an amateur level but it is more out of my love for the sport than the need to satisfy a competitive impulse.</p>
            <hr>
            <div class="volleyball"><h3>Volleyball</h3></div>
                <p>The newest of the sports that I have played is volleyball, and it was something that I never saw myself doing. I was introduced to the sport by a good friend of mine who wanted me to meet new people when I moved to San Diego. This has become the hobby that I do weekly, and I have quickly devloped a love for the game.</p>
                <img class="volleyball" src="images_html/vball_image.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Much of this love has been for the friends that I have met. When I began playing, it was in a simple group of friends playing casually. Since then, we have created a large group of over 60+ members that actively play every Sunday morning. </p>
                <p>Over the past several years I have progressively gotten more proficient at the sport to the points where I am now comfortable enought to play in higher level tournaments. I will even be moving on to attempt to achieve my minor league rating over the next few years. These people have created a comfortable home for me to return to every weekend, and partially helped push me to begin my path of learning to code.
